```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr) #Include the library for dplyr and tidyr.
library(tidyr)

```
Note: warning messages indicate that function names in this package overlap with function names from another package.  

Set warning = F and message = F to suppress messages.

To use a specific function from another package, use  `package::function(...)`
